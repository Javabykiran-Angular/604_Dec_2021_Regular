Difference Between Angular Js & Angular 2+ (2/4/5/6/7/8/9/10/11/12)
BASIC VERSION of Angular
1 Angular Js/angular 1.0
2 Angular 2/4/5/6/7/8/9/10
What is Angular?
 It is front End technology.=> GUI=> graphic user interface
 It is a Fraemwork.
 
which Front end technology?
Angular , React js , Vue Js , Embber Js, JSP

Why Angular?
- Angular is fremawork.
- Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web.
- Angular have module ,declarative templates, dependency injection, services ,end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. 

- Angular build applications that live on the web, mobile,or the desktop.

- Angular has matured into a client-side MVW framework  (i.e. Model-View-Whatever) for building of complex single page Application(SPA).

- It places equal importance on application testing & application writing, while simplifying the development process.

- Angular has tag line One framework Mobile & desktop.

- Cross platform Progressive web apps (i.e. It support all platform mobile,desktop,different os)

- It famous also for his speed & performance (bcz it is optimized for today's javascript virtual machine) 

- It is universal framework (i.e. node.js with express js,.net,php,java & other servers for near-instants server side language)

- It has code splitting
	- It has in build router system to load quickly
	- Users only load code required to render the view they request.
	
- You can create Quick UI views with simple & powerful template syntax.
- Angular is in build CLI(Command Line Interface) Tool,so you fast building,add components & tests it.


<html>
<head>
<title>jfbvzfdh</title>

</head>
<body>
// html tags used 
</body>
</html>

index.html

SPA - Single Page Application
It contain only 1head+1body
SPA environment in the browser — no page reloads, no extra wait time.
Angular These are, many E.g:
Gmail, Google Maps, GitHub.

what is Typescript?
- Typescript is Object Orientated Lang.
- Typescript is superset of javascript
- Developed By Mircosoft 2012
- It was designed by Anders Hejlsberg (designer of C#) at Microsoft
its coding style is used like C++
- The ECMAScript specification is a standardized specification of a scripting language
- ECMAScript standard + ECMAScript version6(JS) + Additional features(Opps Concept,Module)=Typescript


Advantages
1 Strong static typing
       -TypeScript is a typed language, where we can specify the type of the variables, function parameters and object properties
inferred Type to mention Data type of Variable, if not mentioned Data type its by deafault take "any" Data type
2 Find Compile Time Error 
3 Supports 
  - Classess
 - Inheritance
 - interface
- enum
- Function Override

Disadvantage
- Browser Don't understand Typescript 
- Generally TypeScript takes time to compile the code.

tsc =>typescript compiler
tsc --version

Installation
Steps
1 Installed Node
2 Installed IDE VSCode
3 npm install -g typescript
 -npm= Node Package Manager
- g = globally
internet is required

node --version - Its Gives the Information about Node Version

npm --version -Its Gives the Information about npm(Node Package manager) Version

tsc --version  - Its Gives the Information about typescript Version	


Identifier
- Both Character & Digit are allowed
- 1st letter should be character
- 1st letter of digit is not allowed
- special character are not allowed Except (_ and $ )
- No spaces are allowed
- No any special keywords are used for identifire
e.g. 
var a;
var a1;
var a_b;
var a$b;
Above all are allowed

Below are not allowed
var 1a;
var 1_a;
var a b;
Variable: var, let, const
Data types
 - number,string,boolean,any,void
null - Represents an intentional absence of an object value.
undefined - Denotes value given to all uninitialized variables

Null and undefined ─ Are they the same?
The null and the undefined datatypes are often a source of confusion. The null and undefined cannot be used to reference the data type of a variable. They can only be assigned as values to a variable.

Type Assertion
1 angle bracket <>
2 as syntax
